## Problem Statement
In the domain of retail pricing and financial planning, a significant "calculation gap" often exists where business owners or students confuse the distinct mathematical properties of Markup (based on Cost) and Gross Margin (based on Revenue). This confusion, coupled with the tedium of manually rearranging algebraic formulas to solve for missing variables—such as determining a target Cost given a fixed Revenue and desired Margin—frequently leads to pricing errors and profitability loss. The problem is exacerbated by the lack of simple, unified tools that can accept any available financial data points and instantaneously derive the remaining critical metrics, necessitating a flexible computational solution that eliminates human error from these sensitive conversions.

## Scope of the Project
The scope of this project is strictly defined as the development of a Python-based financial logic engine designed to model single-unit pricing scenarios. It encompasses the algorithmic handling of five core variables—Cost, Revenue, Profit, Markup Percentage, and Gross Margin Percentage—and is capable of resolving the complete financial profile from any valid combination of two inputs. While currently implemented as a console-based application to demonstrate the underlying logic and arithmetic accuracy, the scope focuses on the backend calculation utility, ensuring data normalization (handling percentages) and providing a formatted summary, without extending into database storage or multi-product inventory management.

## Target Users
The primary target audience includes small business owners, retail managers, and dropshippers who need to rapidly calculate selling prices to ensure specific profit margins are met without performing manual math. The tool is also highly relevant for commerce and accounting students who require a verification tool to understand the relationship between markup and margin, as well as financial analysts needing a quick utility for spot-checking pricing structures. Additionally, software developers building e-commerce platforms can view this project as a reference implementation for backend pricing logic.

## High-Level Features
The project features a robust multi-directional calculation algorithm that breaks the dependency on standard "Cost + Markup" formulas, allowing users to input any two variables (such as Revenue and Gross Margin) to reverse-engineer the rest. It includes an intelligent data normalizer that automatically converts percentage inputs into decimals for calculation and converts them back for display. The system utilizes a comprehensive if-elif logic structure to handle seven distinct input scenarios, ensures data integrity through basic error handling, and concludes with a Sales Summary Report that displays all five financial metrics rounded to two decimal places for immediate readability.
